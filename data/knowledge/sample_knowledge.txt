MARC Knowledge Base
===================

The MARC (Medical Agentic Report Classification) framework is designed to automate the process of classifying medical reports using a multi-agent pipeline.

Key Features:
- Multi-agent collaboration: Agents work sequentially to analyze reports.
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Agents can access external knowledge to improve accuracy.
- Flexible Configuration: New agents can be added via YAML configuration without changing code.
- Model Agnostic: Different models (like gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro) can be assigned to different agents.

How to add an agent:
1. Open `config/agents.yaml`.
2. Add a new item to the `agents` list.
3. Define the `name`, `model`, and `prompt_file`.
4. If you want the agent to have access to specific data, add the file path to `context_files`.
